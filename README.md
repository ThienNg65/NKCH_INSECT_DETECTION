# Overview:

Title: Insect Recognition Application
Project Code: THS2023-54

## 1. Research on the process of building an object detection model in images
Utilizing the YOLOv8 model for classification implementation:

## 2. Capturing images and constructing a database for insect recognition system.

## 3. Building an object detection model in images.
Training the model on Google Colab.

## 4. Building the application interface.
•	Home Screen: This screen displays a list of specific insect species and allows users to view detailed information when clicked. Below the main screen is a bottom navigation bar containing 3 navigation functions that allow users to access the home page, capture function, and access the user profile.

•	Photo Capture Screen: This screen allows users to capture insect images using the phone's camera or select existing images from the phone gallery.

•	Result Screen: This screen displays the classification results of the insect image. The classification results will include several insect species closest to the diagnosis result by the model.

•	Insect Details: After identifying the insect, users can access detailed information about that insect by navigating through pages using arrow buttons. The information will include scientific name, species, genus, order, class, phylum, kingdom, and additional details such as reproductive form, natural enemies, or characteristics of that insect.

•	User Profile Page: This function allows users to add or modify their personal information.

•	Login Screen: This is where users enter their login information to access the application. If users don't have an account, they can register as a new user. This screen includes text fields for users to enter their email and password to log in, as well as a "Forgot Password" text button for users to reset their password.

•	Registration Screen: This screen is where users create a new account if they don't have a login account yet. It includes text fields prompting users to enter their email, password, and confirm password.

In addition to the functions mentioned above, the application also provides some additional auxiliary functions such as:
•	The Drawer allows users to access the main screen, favorites list, searched insect list, search function, and also enables them to log out of the system.

•	Search Functionality by Family, Order, or Species: The screen includes a search bar displayed as a list of insect species based on the keyword entered by the user from the Android keyboard, allowing users to search for multiple insect species as desired.

•	Favorite List Feature: This feature allows users to save specific insect species or ones they want to review multiple times without needing to access the search bar.

•	Recent Search History Functionality: This feature supports users in easily reviewing previously identified insect species.

•	Hierarchical Expanded List by Family and Order of Insect Species: When accessing a particular insect species, in addition to viewing the detailed characteristics of the insect, users can also browse through a list of insect species classified by the corresponding family and order of that species in the form of a horizontal scroll bar.
